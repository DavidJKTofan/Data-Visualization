# Data-Visualization
Some simple examples of data visualization â€“ using tools like R, Python, and Tableau.

More examples of other Charts can be found here <a href="https://github.com/DavidJKTofan/Data-Visualization/tree/master/Examples" target="_blank">More Charts</a>

## Programming Languages
The following programming languages have been used to create some of the charts: 

- JavaScript (Google Charts)
- R

## Responsive Charts
In order to adapt the size of the chart and make it responsive, you'll have to play with the ChartArea in the JS file, the CSS @media part, as well as the HTML div size (or other layout elements) where the charts should appear. But I am sure you know more about it than me. :)

## Who created this project
My name is David and I've just started to learn programming in general (mid-2019). Google Charts are free to use and I simply adapted some of the code found in the documentation. Feel free to use any of the examples for your own projects.
