# Interactive Horizontal Bar Chart
How to create an interactive <a href="https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/barchart" target="_blank">Horizontal Bar Chart</a> with <a href="https://developers.google.com/chart/" target="_blank">Google Charts</a>?
<br>
I wanted to know how to create a horizontal bar chart which changes the data shown when a specific button is pressed.

Here is the <a href="https://github.com/DavidJKTofan/Interactive-Horizontal-Bar-Chart/blob/master/All_in_one_page.html" target="_blank">entire HTML page</a> to preview in any HTML editor. 
<br>
Additionally, the files can also be found separated into <a href="https://github.com/DavidJKTofan/Interactive-Horizontal-Bar-Chart/blob/master/CSS/main.css" target="_blank">main.css</a>, <a href="https://github.com/DavidJKTofan/Interactive-Horizontal-Bar-Chart/blob/master/JavaScript/googlechart.js" target="_blank">googlechart.js</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/DavidJKTofan/Interactive-Horizontal-Bar-Chart/blob/master/index.html" target="_blank">index.html</a>.
## Programming Languages
The following programming languages have been used to create the chart: HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.

## Responsive Chart
In order to adapt the size of the chart and make it responsive, you'll have to play with the ChartArea in the JS file, the CSS @media part, as well as the HTML div size (or other layout elements) where the chart should appear.

## Who created this project
My name is David and I've just started to learn programming in general (mid-2019). Google Charts are free to use and I simply adapted some of the code found in the documentation.
