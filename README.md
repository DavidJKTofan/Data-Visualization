# Interactive Charts
How to create an interactive <a href="https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/barchart" target="_blank">Horizontal Bar Chart</a> with <a href="https://developers.google.com/chart/" target="_blank">Google Charts</a>?
<br>
It all started with me wanting to know how to create a horizontal bar chart which changes the data shown when a specific button is pressed.
<br>
<br>
Here is the <a href="https://github.com/DavidJKTofan/Interactive-Google-Charts/blob/master/BarChart-Buttons.html" target="_blank">BarChart</a> to preview in any HTML editor or browser.

More examples of other Charts can be found here <a href="https://github.com/DavidJKTofan/Interactive-Google-Charts/tree/master/Examples" target="_blank">More Charts</a>

## Programming Languages
The following programming languages have been used to create the chart: HTML5, CSS and JavaScript (Google Charts).

## Responsive Chart
In order to adapt the size of the chart and make it responsive, you'll have to play with the ChartArea in the JS file, the CSS @media part, as well as the HTML div size (or other layout elements) where the chart should appear.

## Who created this project
My name is David and I've just started to learn programming in general (mid-2019). Google Charts are free to use and I simply adapted some of the code found in the documentation.

This is one of my first projects (just for fun) :) so please don't be too harsh on me.
